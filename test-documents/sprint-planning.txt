==========================================

Executive Summary
-----------------
This document outlines the key objectives and deliverables for Sprint 23 of Project Alpha. The sprint runs from December 11th to December 25th, 2025.

Sprint Goals
------------
1. Complete user authentication module with OAuth2 integration
2. Implement dashboard analytics feature
3. Fix critical bug in payment processing (JIRA-1234)
4. Performance optimisation for database queries

Team Assignments
----------------
- Sarah Chen: Lead developer for authentication module
- Marcus Johnson: Dashboard analytics implementation
- Elena Rodriguez: Payment bug investigation and fix
- David Kim: Database optimisation
- Alex Thompson: Code review and QA coordination

Key Deadlines
-------------
- December 15th: Authentication module code complete
- December 18th: Dashboard analytics MVP ready for review
- December 20th: Payment bug fix deployed to staging
- December 23rd: Final sprint review and demo

Known Risks and Blockers
------------------------
1. BLOCKER: OAuth2 provider documentation is incomplete - Sarah needs to contact their support team
2. RISK: Analytics dashboard requires new API endpoints from backend team - dependency on Team Bravo
3. RISK: Payment bug root cause still under investigation - may need database access logs
4. RISK: David is out sick Monday-Wednesday, database work may slip

Action Items from Last Standup

- Marcus to sync with Team Bravo lead about API timeline (Due: Dec 12)
- Elena to request database access logs from DevOps (Due: Dec 11)
- Alex to set up automated testing pipeline for payment module (Due: Dec 13)

Budget Constraints
------------------
- No additional cloud resources approved for this sprint
- Must work within existing infrastructure limits
- Any overtime requires manager approval from Lisa Park

Success Criteria
----------------
- All unit tests passing with >80% coverage
- No P1 bugs in production
- Sprint velocity maintained at 45 story points
- Customer satisfaction score above 4.2/5
- All code reviewed before merge

Open Questions for Discussion
-----------------------------
1. Should we prioritise mobile responsiveness in this sprint?
2. What is the fallback plan if OAuth2 integration is delayed?
3. Do we need a dedicated QA resource for payment testing?
4. Can we get temporary contractor support for David's absence?

Meeting Agenda Items
--------------------
- Each team member provides status update
- Discuss blockers and help needed
- Review timeline adjustments
- Assign new action items
